Final Project Proposal
Question I am trying to answer: “How do new users’ sentiments with the company change over time?”
Why this question is worth answering: From a personal perspective, this question is worth answering because I am a fan of both Amazon and shopping online for items rather than buying in person. Even though I am typically satisfied with my purchases when I buy something online, I often wonder if there are people who dislike their experience and never buy items again, or if their relationship with Amazon/online shopping decreases over time.
My hypothesis: I believe there will be multiple “types” of reviewers that cannot be categorized into a single, uniform behavior.
Why this hypothesis makes sense: I believe most users leave one or two reviews maximum throughout their Amazon experience, while only a select few are consistent throughout the years, so it is difficult to “capture” this behavior.
