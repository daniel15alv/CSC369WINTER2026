Using the preprocessed r/place dataset from Week3 Analysis, Week4Analysis.py, computed inter-event timing for each user and then flagged accounts whose pixel placements occur at very unnatural short intervals. A "short" interval was defined using the distribution of inter-event timing, meaning any intervals below the 1st percentile of user inter-event times were considered to be extremely fast and unrealistic for a human.
For mass coordinated events, pixel placements are aggregated into fixed windows of only one second in length. Extreme spikes in these single-second windows indicate lots of activity going on, to the point where these activies must be coordinated or synchronized by mass users. Thresholds were derived from identifying large "bursts" in pixel acitivity by comparing the number of distinct users active in short time windows against the upper tail of the distribution. Users and time windows exceeding these thresholds were considered "flagged".
